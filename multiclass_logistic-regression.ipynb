    "In the previous sections, we learnt how to use Sklearn's LogisticRegression module and how to fine tune the parameters for 2 class or binary class problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will learn how to use the LogisticRegression for a multiclass problem involving 3 or more classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the sklearn documentation, in the multiclass scenario, the LogisticRegression algorithm uses the one-vs-rest (OvR) scheme if the ‘multi_class’ option is set to ‘ovr’.\n",
    "It uses the cross-entropy loss if the ‘multi_class’ option is set to ‘multinomial’. \n",
    "\n",
    "A multiclass option of ‘multinomial’ is supported only by certain solvers such as the ‘lbfgs’, ‘sag’, ‘saga’ and ‘newton-cg’.\n",
